
Node is for implementing a tree structure, so its methods are for firstChild, lastChild, childNodes, etc. It is more of a class for a generic tree structure.

And then, some Node objects are also Element objects.  Element inherits from Node. Element objects actually represents the objects as specified in the HTML file by the tags such as <div id="content"></div>. The Element class define properties and methods such as attributes, id, innerHTML, clientWidth, blur(), and focus().

Some Node objects are text nodes and they are not Element objects. Each Node object has a nodeType property that indicates what type of node it is, for HTML documents:

1: Element node
3: Text node
8: Comment node
9: the top level node, which is document
We can see some examples in the console:

> document instanceof Node
  true

> document instanceof Element
  false
